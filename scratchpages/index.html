    <h1>Sengoku Warlords</h1>
    <h2>Created by Charlotte Pendell</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="content">The Sengoku warlords, known as daimyō, were powerful feudal lords who ruled over Japan’s provinces during the
    Sengoku period — a time of near-constant military conflict, political intrigue, and social upheaval that spanned
    from the mid-15th to early 17th centuries. In an era where the central government collapsed, these warlords battled
    for dominance, forging alliances, raising armies, and expanding their territories through both strategy and force.
    Their ambition and rivalry shaped the landscape of Japanese history, leaving behind a legacy of iconic castles,
    samurai culture, and legendary figures like <a href="#oda">Oda Nobunaga,</a> <a href="#hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, and <a href="#ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. The Sengoku
    warlords were not just warriors, but master tacticians and rulers who redefined Japan’s future.
