                <h3 class="post-subtitle">One of the most well-known legends about Oda Nobunaga comes from a proverb
                    comparing him to other great warlords. Faced with a bird that wouldn’t sing, Nobunaga said,
                    “Kill it.” This simple line symbolized his ruthless and decisive nature. Though apocryphal, the
                    story reflects his reputation as a bold reformer who would stop at nothing to unify Japan,
                    breaking traditions and crushing resistance to achieve his vision.

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Before becoming a great leader, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was known for his
                    determination and cleverness. One legend tells of a time when he was tasked with tiling a large
                    temple roof—a job that seemed impossible for a man of his rank and experience. Instead of
                    complaining, he rallied local workers, organized them efficiently, and completed the task faster
                    than anyone expected. His ability to lead and inspire, even in small tasks, caught the attention
                    of Oda Nobunaga. This tale highlights how Hideyoshi’s brilliance in organization and people
                    skills paved his way to becoming one of Japan’s most powerful figures.</h3>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Takeda Shingen, the “Tiger of Kai,” was famous for his military tactics and
                    his emblematic battle standard, which read: “Swift as the wind, silent as the forest, fierce as
                    fire, and immovable as a mountain.” This motto, inspired by Sun Tzu's Art of War, became legendary
                    and symbolized his strategic mastery on the battlefield. His ability to strike quickly and vanish or
                    stand firm when needed earned him a fearsome reputation.</h3>

                    Shingen. Despite their fierce enmity, a famous story tells of Kenshin sending salt to Shingen when
                    his domain was cut off by a salt embargo. Kenshin believed that wars should be fought with swords,
                    not starvation. This honorable gesture made him a symbol of bushidō—the way of the warrior—and
                    earned him admiration even from his enemies.</h3>
